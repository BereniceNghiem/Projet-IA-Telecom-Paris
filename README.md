## Title
Pushing the limits of a denoising model on microscopy images: Identify breaking modes and extend to super-enhancement use-cases

## Summary
Blurring artefacts are common in microscopy images. Such artefacts are sometimes present in only part of the field of view. This project will study the extension of a CycleGan-based image deblurring method [1] and/or a Diffusion based model [2] to detect and correct for local blur. Data from open cohorts will be used first [3]. In-house images of cells acquired in a laboratory at Ecole Polytechnique, specialized in microfluidic technologies will then be used as a 2nd use-case.
